# dtlnor-ref-mhrsb-scripts

 some random weird scripts I write for research purpose

- DisplayAllQuest.lua

  old name quest.lua, same as nexus mod
- dumpEM.lua

  just use for dumping the EmTypes and EnemyTypeIndex Dictionary
- effect_show.lua

  put all the container ID and element ID displayed to screen. (write from request, I don't know efx)
  ver 2.0 added vfx display by 折戟沉沙, thank you.
- FixedEmScale.lua

  same as nexus mod
- ForceArenaQuest.lua

  same as nexus mod ~~actually if I complete this script with more field dumped it could be a quest editor~~
- infRiding.lua

  same as neuxs mod
- lowest_hp.lua

  same as neuxs mod
- monster_has_hp_bar_multiPartVersion.lua

  copy paste from cursey's showcase but adding some part hp to show on the screen (idk if Overlay already supported)
- motionIDBankID.lua

  showing the current motion id and bank id only (take out from rich info display)
- No_map_zako.lua

  same as nexus mod
- no_side_monster.lua

  modified verision of ForceArenaQuest.lua. deprecated, not going to update.
- noRiding.lua

  meaningless on sun break haha
- rich_info_display.lua

  smash tons of text to the screen.
  start from a random script displaying random info I want to take a look, and I mess up too many shit inside but keep updating it. and finally idk what I'm writing as those code are so messy and chaos. I didn't care about efficiency when writing and finally it has a huge performance impact to the game haha. The script crash randomly ~~just lazy to fix~~ and I am not guarantee it will work everytime I update.
- someCheat.lua

  someCheat which is useful when I do random testing in game.
